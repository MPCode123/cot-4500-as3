# cot-4500-as3

The following repository will consist of 2 methods: Euler's Method and Runge-Kutta Method (order 4)
- The code is done on Python 3.11 on Eclipse, uploaded to Github
- To run the script: python test_assignment_3.py (this is where all the test cases are)
- You may view the files uploaded to ensure proper running efficiency
- Packages: sys, os
- BOTH METHODS UTILIZE THE SAME FUNCTION

## Euler Method
This method consist of step-size (h), iterations (N), and inital point of f(0) = 1
- This utilizes a midpoint

## Runge-Kutta Method
Similar to Euler except it uses multiple midpoints

Note: Code is inspired by the COT4500 powerpoint slides; ALL problems are located within test_assignment_3 with the "know how" in assignment_3
